#### Electronics | Embedded Systems | Programming | Always Learning

Welcome to my personal website! 

My name is *Mohammad Ahmad ALhamad*, and **MAAL** comes from the first letters of my full name.

I'm passionate about electronics, embedded systems, and building things from the ground up - whether it's programming microcontrollers, designing PCBs, or prototyping machines with 3D-printed parts.

This site is where I share my projects, experiments, and ideas as I continue learning and creating. ðŸš€âœ¨
